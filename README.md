<a href="/"> emptytra.in</a> is a live audiovisual stream of the JMZ train in New York City. The feed captures a position slightly west of Myrtle/Broadway, usually a busy, raucous intersection. Since the establishment of social distancing measures, the noise has gradually lessened, and I have come to notice the increasingly empty trains pass by in the window. By providing a slightly blurred and digitally effected stream, I hope to provide ongoing, anonymized documentation of the pandemic as manifested through the quieting city.
